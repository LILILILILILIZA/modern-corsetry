Trial of a personnal idea: why not combine 3D printing and AI with the historical corstetry knowledge, to make back braces more comfortable for teenagers having scoliosis ? 


## Introduction
As it is, back braces are made using a 3D scan of the body, and medical input from the specialist, tellng where there should be force applied in which direction. A resin brace is then made, with more foam applied inside where there should be pressure, and a hole in the resin where the body should move. These are quite uncomfortable, as well as not sustainable at all. The goal here would be to use the same inputs, but to produce a back brace inspired by historical corsetry. Corsets are comfortable if made to measure, and offer more body movement than a resin brace. Using steel boning in strategic points could possibly help achieve the desired pressure points. This method would have the huge drawback of needing sewing, making it time-consuming and expensive. Additive fabrication could be a direction to explore to solve the issue of sewing.
